# Algorithm Explanation
The algorithm used is DFA Minimization via the Table-Filling Method (distinguishable pairs method):

Initialization:

Represent all possible pairs of states (i, j) with i < j.

Initially, assume all pairs are equivalent (can be merged).

Marking Non-Equivalent Pairs:

Mark as non-equivalent any pair where:

One state is a final (accepting) state, and the other is not.

Iterative Refinement:

Repeatedly check each pair (i, j):

For each symbol in the alphabet, find the next states (next_i, next_j).

If the next states are already known to be non-equivalent, mark (i, j) as non-equivalent.

Repeat until no changes occur.

Collect Equivalent Pairs:

After refinement, the remaining pairs marked as equivalent are output in lexicographic order.

Complexity:

Worst-case time complexity: O(n² · |Σ|),
where n = number of states, and |Σ| = size of the alphabet.
